# Ask-style — junior-friendly English `AskUserQuestion`

> **Reference-only.** Not a skill. Every skill that calls `AskUserQuestion` reads this for the
> canonical shape of questions and options. The rule: an **option label is the next mechanical
> step the skill takes**, not just a name; the **description explains, in plain words, what will
> happen** — written so a first-year junior can pick correctly without a senior beside them.

> **Volume vs. style.** How **many** questions a Q&A skill asks scales with the interview-depth dial
> (easy asks few, hard asks all — see [`interview-depth.md`](./interview-depth.md)). The **per-question
> explanatory rule below is unchanged at every depth** — even a single easy-level question is glossed
> and explained in full. Depth tunes the count; it never licenses a dry question.

> **Orchestrated runs.** Under `/sdd:orchestrate` the reader of every question is the orchestrator,
> not a human — the runner returns it as `SDD_QUESTIONS` ([`orchestration.md`](./orchestration.md)). The
> shape and the explanatory rule below apply **unchanged**: the orchestrator did not see the runner's
> context either, so a dry question is just as unanswerable.

## The one rule that matters most

**Never ask dryly.** The most common failure is a terse, jargon-dense question — a few words plus acronyms, no context — that forces the user to already know the project to answer. Fix it two ways, every time:

1. **Gloss every technical term inline, on first use** — the plain meaning in parentheses, right there. Not «order by RICE» but «order by RICE — a quick score, Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort, where higher = more value per unit of work». Not «forces a worktree» but «forces a worktree — a separate working copy of the repo so two agents don't edit the same files». The reader should never have to look a term up to choose.
2. **Spend the words on the WHY and the trade-off**, not the WHAT. A short label is fine; the *description* is where you explain — in plain language — what happens, what you gain and lose, and the hidden catch.

If a question reads like a config dump or a spec excerpt, it's wrong. Write it as if explaining the choice to a capable colleague who just joined and doesn't know your acronyms yet. **More explanation always beats less here** — a long, clear description is a feature, not bloat.

## Shape

- **`question`** — 3–4 sentences in three blocks:
  - **CONTEXT** — why this decision, what scenario to picture, what exactly we're deciding (one sentence with a concrete example).
  - **WHY IT MATTERS** — which quality goal / NFR / spec vector it touches; reversibility (irreversible? multi-module? affects performance / security / UX?); the main trade-off in play.
  - **READ OPTIONS** — a nudge to read the descriptions before choosing.
- **Each option**:
  - `label` — 1–5 words, **action form** = the next mechanical step: “Approve”, “Edit”, “Save as Open Question”, “Drop”, “Record as ADR”. Add “(Recommended)” to the first option when you recommend it.
  - `description` — 3–5 sentences with four mandatory elements (below).

## The four mandatory elements of a `description`

1. **What technically happens** — concrete names: tables / endpoints / files / ADR numbers. Not «modify the API» but «add field `is_active BOOLEAN` to table `members` and a new route in the module's handler».
2. **What you gain / what you lose** — the trade-off in plain words, **every technical term glossed**:
   - not «backfill migration» → «a script that walks every existing row and fills the new field; while it runs the rows are read-locked for writes»
   - not «cursor pagination» → «the client sends the last id it saw so the next page starts after it; avoids `OFFSET`, which slows down on large pages»
   - not «GIN index» → «a special index type that lets you search inside JSON columns, but takes 3–5× more space and writes slower»
3. **The skill's next mechanical step** — «I spawn ADR-NNNN titled X, add a row to the §9 ADR table, the schema is locked for the data-model stage».
4. **Hidden trade-off** — if there's a condition under which the choice breaks («only works if Redis is already in your stack», «in 6 months you'll need downtime for a backfill», «existing users have to re-login»), state it **right in the description**, not in a follow-up. A junior won't see that trigger on their own.

## Language

- **English throughout** — labels and descriptions. Technical identifiers stay in their original form (ADR, JSONB, JWT, UUID, FK, OpenAPI)—they are names. Use English action labels such as “Approve”, “Edit”, “Save to §11 OQ”, and “Drop”.
- Glossary roles and domain-invariant **names** (natural-language phrases such as “no published lessons”) are allowed—they are business terms.
- This section governs **conversation** (question + option text) only. The language documents are *written in* is a separate per-project switch — `artifact_language` in `.claude/sdd.local.md` → [`artifact-language.md`](./artifact-language.md).

## Forbidden

- Terse English labels («Approve», «Edit», «Drop», «Reword»).
- One-line descriptions.
- Technical terms without a gloss (UNION, backfill, GIN, cursor, idempotent, transactional…).
- Trade-offs hidden in a follow-up («if you pick this I'll later ask about X, which has complexity Y»).

## Counter-example (deprecated) vs correct

```
# DON'T — opaque next step, no gloss
- label: "Approve"
  description: "Apply decision."

# DO — action-form label, description names the concrete step + glossed trade-off
- label: "Approve JSONB column (→ spawn ADR-0002)"
  description: "One `body` jsonb column stores the complete block array as JSON. BENEFIT: edit a lesson with one UPDATE; a new block type needs no schema migration. COST: block validation moves to the app layer (the database does not know the types); searching inside `body` needs a GIN index (a special PostgreSQL index for JSON searches that takes 3–5× more space and slows writes). RESULT: I spawn ADR-0002 with three considered options, add a row in §9, and lock the schema for the data-model stage."
```

## The 4-state actions, phrased this way (canonical set)

```
- label: "Approve as is"
  description: "I keep the decision verbatim and run the next check (the gate, if this section has one)."
- label: "Edit"
  description: "You provide the new wording or value; I regenerate the decision under that constraint and ask once more (one round—the second answer is final)."
- label: "Save as Open Question"
  description: "I remove the decision from the section and add a row to the Open Questions table with an owner and due date (which I ask for next). Without both, the decision becomes a Drop."
- label: "Drop"
  description: "I remove the decision. If it is mandatory, I reframe the options and ask again; if optional, I leave it out without a replacement."
```

## Dry → explanatory (worked rewrite)

```
# TOO DRY (jargon-dense, no context — the failure to avoid):
Question: "Prioritize Next by RICE or manual?"
Options:
  - label: "RICE"
    description: "RICE score, ordered desc."
  - label: "Manual"
    description: "Manual order."

# EXPLANATORY (context + why + glossed terms — do this):
Question:
  "How should we decide the ORDER of the not-yet-started ideas in the roadmap's «Next» list?
   This only affects which problem we pick up next — nothing is committed yet, and you can always
   reorder. The trade-off: a scoring formula is more objective but takes a minute per idea; eyeballing
   it is faster but drifts with mood. Read both options below."
Options:
  - label: "Score each idea (Recommended)"
    description: "I rate every Next idea with RICE — a quick score = Reach (how many users it touches) ×
      Impact (how much it moves the needle, 3 down to 0.25) × Confidence (how sure we are, as a %) ÷
      Effort (rough person-weeks). It gives one sortable number per idea, so «Next» orders itself by
      value-per-effort. You can still override any ranking by hand. Costs ~a minute of estimating per idea."
  - label: "Just order them by hand"
    description: "No formula — you (or I) drag the ideas into the order that feels right; row position =
      priority. Faster and fine for a short list, but with many ideas it gets subjective and the order
      tends to drift over time. You can switch to scoring later if the list grows."
```

The dry version is unanswerable without knowing what RICE is; the explanatory version teaches the term in the act of asking and makes the trade-off obvious.

## Why (feedback, 2026-05-23 + reinforced 2026-05-29)

The user is a PM, methodist, or junior developer opening the repo for the first time. Terse questions give them neither the substance of the decision nor the difference between options. Feedback on 2026-05-23 asked for explanations that are more understandable for people who are literally junior developers. Follow-up feedback on 2026-05-29 requested more explanatory questions and answer options because the agent was asking too dryly and using too many terms in too little text. The dryness and term density were still occurring, so this file leads with the “never ask dryly / gloss every term” rule above.
