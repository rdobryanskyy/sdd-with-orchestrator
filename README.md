# SDD — Spec-Driven Development for Claude Code

A self-contained Claude Code plugin that carries a feature from a one-line idea to
**reviewed, verified, shipped** code through **20 atomic, stack-agnostic skills** and a
**TDD implementation engine** — with a living roadmap above the per-feature flow, and an
**orchestrator** that can drive the whole thing for you from a plain-language description.

Every skill is Socratic (it walks decisions with you, it doesn't dump a wall of output),
gated (a stage hard-refuses when its prerequisite artifact is missing), and stack-agnostic
(no language, tracker, or test tool is hard-coded — the skills detect what your repo uses).
The Q&A skills (`specify` / `clarify` / `design`) are also **depth-tunable** — an easy / medium / hard
dial decides how much the skill decides for you vs. interrogates you with trade-offs.

## Install

**Claude Code** — native plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add rdobryanskyy/sdd
/plugin install sdd@sdd
```

After updating to a new release: re-run `/plugin install sdd@sdd`, then `/reload-plugins`.

**Codex CLI** — `cd` into your project first: the script installs into the **current directory**
(`.agents/skills/` + `.codex/agents/`). Add `--global` after `codex` to install under `~` instead,
or `--prefix DIR` to install under an arbitrary directory (useful for trying it out in a sandbox):

```sh
cd your-project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdobryanskyy/sdd/main/install.sh | bash -s -- codex
```

Then restart codex (skills are discovered at session start) and type `$sdd-specify`.

Alternative — the plugin marketplace. Note that `add` only **registers** the marketplace, it
installs nothing by itself:

```text
codex plugin marketplace add rdobryanskyy/sdd
```

then **inside codex** run `/plugins`, switch to the `sdd` marketplace tab and pick
**Install plugin**. One naming nuance: the marketplace install registers the **original** skill
names (`$specify`), while the installer script prefixes them — `$sdd-specify` — because bare
names like `review` / `design` / `api` collide with generic skills. **Pick one of the two paths,
not both** — they register different names for the same skills, so running both shows every
skill twice. To undo the script install: re-run `install.sh codex --uninstall` from the same
directory (or with the same `--global` / `--prefix`). To undo the marketplace install: `/plugins`
→ the sdd tab → uninstall (or remove the `[plugins."sdd@…"]` entry from `~/.codex/config.toml`).
The script warns when it detects a marketplace install already registered.

> **Windows note.** The installer is a bash script — run it from Git Bash or WSL. The directories
> it writes (`.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`) start with a dot, which Explorer hides by
> default — enable «Hidden items» (or `dir /a`) to see them.

**Cursor** (2.4+) — the same script; `cd` into your project first (installs into
`.cursor/skills/` + `.cursor/agents/` of the current directory; `--global` for `~`,
`--prefix DIR` for an arbitrary directory):

```sh
cd your-project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdobryanskyy/sdd/main/install.sh | bash -s -- cursor
```

Then restart Cursor (or run **Developer: Reload Window**) and invoke a stage by typing `/` in
the chat and picking `sdd-specify`. (Cursor also reads `.agents/skills/`, so a Codex install is
already visible to Cursor.) Once the plugin is listed on the Cursor marketplace, installing from
the in-app marketplace panel works too — project- or user-scoped.

How every Claude-specific mechanism — `AskUserQuestion`, subagents, `/clear`, the implement
engine modes — maps to Codex / Cursor is one table:
[`skills/_shared/tool-adapters.md`](./skills/_shared/tool-adapters.md).

## Start here

Two ways to drive the pipeline:

- **Autopilot — `/sdd:orchestrate "<what you want>"`.** You describe the feature once; the
  orchestrator (strongest model) gives every stage to its own agent, answers every question the
  stages ask, and stops at an open PR with a **decision ledger** you audit
  ([details + diagrams below](#the-orchestrator-autopilot)).
- **Hands-on — run each stage yourself**, answering its questions (the rest of this section).

The flow is a straight line: **each stage writes a file the next one reads.** Run them in order
(the diagram + table are just below).

```text
/sdd:survey                         ← once per repo: map an existing codebase, OR bootstrap an empty one
/sdd:specify checkout-discounts     ← interviews you, writes the spec (you don't bring one)
/sdd:design … → /sdd:implement … → /sdd:review … → /sdd:ship
```

Two things to know up front: **`survey` runs once per repo** — on an existing codebase it maps the
current architecture to `docs/architecture-map.md` (every later stage reads it); on an empty repo it
runs a short foundation session and scaffolds the skeleton ([detail below](#where-we-study-the-codebase--hold-the-current-architecture)).
And **`specify` *creates* the spec** from a short interview — you bring the idea, not the document.

From there you walk the backbone in order. Each step reads the previous step's file and
refuses if it's missing, so you can't skip ahead by accident.

**Every stage ends with a copy-ready handoff block** ([`skills/_shared/handoff.md`](./skills/_shared/handoff.md)):
*What I did* + *Review before continuing* (links to the files it wrote, so you can eyeball them at the
gate) + *Run next* — **`/clear`**, then the next `/sdd:…` command in a fenced block you copy in one
click. The `/clear` matters because each stage is gated and **re-reads its inputs from disk**, so it
needs no carryover — clearing keeps the context small and stops one stage's chatter from drifting into
the next. (Loop-backs are the exception — when `review` bounces back to `implement`, you stay in
context to iterate; utilities make `/clear` optional.) It looks like this:

```md
## ✅ specify — checkout-discounts

**What I did**
- wrote docs/features/checkout-discounts/spec.md — size M (from .size); proposed commit `spec: checkout-discounts`

**Review before continuing**
- docs/features/checkout-discounts/spec.md — goals, user stories, the §5 acceptance criteria

**Run next**
1. /clear — mandatory (fresh context; the next stage re-reads its inputs from disk)
2. then run:  /sdd:clarify checkout-discounts
```

## The flow

There are three kinds of skill. Most of your time is the **backbone** — a straight line you
walk in order. A few are **utilities** you call whenever you need them. Two **close the loop**
after the code is written. On top sits one optional **orchestrator** (`orchestrate`) that walks all
of it for you — every stage in its own agent, every decision made by the orchestrator. Dashed
boxes are the optional stages the route may skip when their N/A condition holds.

### Step 0 — survey (once per repo, before the backbone)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **survey** | Existing repo → scans once, persists the current architecture. Empty repo → level-adaptive foundation session → fixes the foundation + emits a scaffold `tasks.json` for `implement`. | the repo → `docs/architecture-map.md` (+ scaffold `tasks.json` on greenfield) |

### Backbone — the straight line (run in order)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **specify** | Interviews you to capture the idea, writes the product spec + acceptance criteria (reads the architecture map for constraints) | *your idea*, `architecture-map.md` → `spec.md` |
| 2 | **clarify** | Sweeps the spec for ambiguities (a devil's-advocate pass), closes or defers each | `spec.md` → tightened `spec.md` |
| 3 | **design** | **Matches the feature to your existing architecture** (see below) + **declares the target surfaces**, writes the Arc42 SAD + C4 + ADRs | `spec.md` (+ `CONTEXT.md` if present) → `sad.md`, `adr/*` |
| 4 | **sequences** | Draws the runtime flows as Mermaid sequence diagrams | `sad.md` → `sad.md §6` |
| 5 | **data-model** | Designs the schema and writes the actual forward+rollback migrations — **staged** under the feature folder, not the live tree (`implement` promotes them) | `spec.md`, `sad.md`, sequences → `data-model.md`, staged `migrations/*.up/down.sql` |
| 6 | **api** | Derives the OpenAPI contract from the data model (or the existing schema on the fast lane) + sequences + spec | `data-model.md`, sequences, `spec.md` → `contracts/openapi.yaml` |
| 7 | **tasks** | Breaks the work into atomic ≤1-day tasks + a `tasks.json` dependency DAG | all of the above → `tasks/*`, **`tasks.json`** |
| 8 | **plan-tests** | Maps every acceptance criterion to ≥1 test (inline in the spec for XS/S) | `spec.md`, `data-model.md` → `test-plan.md` (M+) or an inline `## Test plan` in `spec.md` (XS/S) |
| 9 | **implement** | The TDD engine: writes a failing test, makes it pass, gates, commits — per task; **promotes** each staged migration into the live `migrations/` as it builds | `tasks.json` + all artifacts → code + tests + promoted migrations, committed |

### Close the loop (after the code is written)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **review** | An **independent, clean-context** code review of the *whole* change against spec/AC + quality | the diff + `spec.md` → review record, `PASS` / `CHANGES REQUESTED` |
| 11 | **ship** | **Verifies the feature actually runs** (not just green tests), writes the changelog, opens the PR | the reviewed change → changelog + PR (never auto-merges) |

`review` can bounce back to `implement` if it finds an unmet acceptance criterion. `ship` is the
end: a reviewed, verified change with a changelog and an open PR — merging to main stays your call.

> **"We test and review, right?"** Yes — in two places. `implement` runs a **per-task gate**
> (unit + integration + lint + vet) on every task as it goes, so each task is green before it's
> committed. Then `review` does the **independent, whole-change** code review a human reviewer
> would do on the PR, and `ship` **runs the feature for real** against its acceptance criteria.
> Tests-pass happens continuously inside `implement`; the cross-cutting review + real-world
> verification are the explicit `review` and `ship` steps.

### Utilities — call whenever you need them (not part of the line)

- **interview** *(before specify)* — stress-test a raw idea before you commit to a spec: a Socratic pass that surfaces hidden assumptions, names tradeoffs, and proposes sharper angles, ending with the weakest spot + the next step (usually `/sdd:specify`). Any idea, not just features; optional — reach for it when the idea itself isn't settled.
- **classify-size** — size the feature XS/S/M/L/XL (writes `.size`); later skills read it to decide MVP vs full depth. Run it at the start, or any time scope changes.
- **glossary** — capture a domain term in `CONTEXT.md` with a definition. Run it whenever a new term shows up; `design` and the spec read the glossary.
- **decide-adr** — write a standalone ADR after the fact, when `tasks` (or a review) flags a decision that needs recording but wasn't captured during `design`.
- **fix** — the **bugfix entry point**: reproduce, trace the symptom to the spec's acceptance
  criteria (regression / ambiguous AC / uncovered gap), pin it with a failing test, apply the
  minimal fix through the same gate `implement` runs, then patch the spec and write a fix record
  under `_fixes/`. Works on a repo with no specs at all (fixes code-first, recommends `survey`).

## The orchestrator (autopilot)

`/sdd:orchestrate` runs the **whole pipeline from one description**. The orchestrator is the main
session running on the strongest model (`opus`, `effort: max`); it is the **only decision-maker**.
Every stage runs in its own fresh **`stage-runner`** agent, which follows that stage's `SKILL.md`
unchanged — but instead of asking *you*, it hands every question and every sub-agent it needs **up**
to the orchestrator. The orchestrator answers, runs the sub-agents, routes to the next stage, loops
review → implement, and writes every decision with its grounding into a **decision ledger**
(`docs/features/<slug>/_orchestrator/run.md`).

```text
/sdd:orchestrate "Let fleet customers export their monthly mileage report as CSV from the portal"
/sdd:orchestrate mileage-export --brief=docs/tickets/FLEET-412.md --depth=hard
/sdd:orchestrate mileage-export "…" --until=tasks        # plan-only: stop before any code
/sdd:orchestrate mileage-export --resume                 # continue a stopped run from run.md
```

### Who does what

    OR --> PR([open PR — never merged])
    classDef orch fill:#fff4d6,stroke:#b8860b,stroke-width:2px
    class OR orch
```

Why this split: a sub-agent **cannot spawn sub-agents**, so the lead (the orchestrator) owns every
dispatch; the judgment agents keep their clean context (the runner that wrote a draft never grades
it); and each stage starts empty and re-reads its inputs from disk, so no stage's chatter leaks into
the next. The stage skills are **not** rewritten — the same 19 skills still work hands-on.

### One stage, end to end (the relay loop)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant L as run.md (ledger)
    participant R as stage-runner (design)

    participant D as docs/features/slug

    R->>D: read spec.md, architecture-map.md, CONTEXT.md
    R-->>O: SDD_QUESTIONS (target surfaces? module boundary?) with full options
    O->>D: grep only the cited sections
    O->>L: D-021, D-022 + grounding (or UNGROUNDED)
    O->>R: SDD_ANSWERS (resume the same agent)
    R->>D: write + commit the resolved section
    Note over R: Socratic walk continues section by section<br/>(more SDD_QUESTIONS rounds, one commit per section)
    R-->>O: SDD_DISPATCH critic (full self-contained prompt)
    O->>C: dispatch sdd:critic (clean context)
    C-->>O: cited findings
    O->>R: SDD_REPORTS (verbatim)
    R-->>O: SDD_QUESTIONS (resolve finding F4?)
    O->>L: D-023
    O->>R: SDD_ANSWERS
    R->>D: apply the critic resolution, finalise sad.md + adr/*, commit
    R-->>O: SDD_STAGE_DONE (files, commits[], next=sequences, handoff block)
    O->>O: verify every commit in git log · tree clean
    O->>L: stage log row · route check against .route
```

If the host can't resume a finished agent, the orchestrator **replays**: a fresh runner gets the
answer sheet so far, resumes from what the stage already wrote and committed (never re-bootstrapping
or re-committing), applies known answers by their stable question id, and stops only at the next
new one.

```

Every stage node above is a separate `stage-runner` agent. Any stage can also end in a **stop** —
a gate that blocks twice, a red that survives escalation with `stop_on_red: true`, an ungrounded
question your escalate policy routes to you, a dirty tree, or anything destructive (force-push,
history rewrite) — and the report gives the exact `--resume` command.

```

Settings (in `.claude/sdd.local.md`): `orchestrator_depth` (default `medium` — `hard` costs tokens,
not your attention, since the orchestrator answers), `orchestrator_escalate` (`none` — decide
everything and flag; `business` — ask you for ungrounded business rules; `hard` — also for
ungrounded irreversible technical calls), `orchestrator_max_review_loops` (default `2`),
`orchestrator_open_pr` (default `true` — the orchestrator pushes and opens the PR after `ship`;
`false` prints the command instead). The full
rulebook: [`skills/orchestrate/references/decision-policy.md`](./skills/orchestrate/references/decision-policy.md);
the relay contract: [`skills/_shared/orchestration.md`](./skills/_shared/orchestration.md).

> **Review the ledger, not just the diff.** The orchestrator never invents silently: every decision
> it could not ground is marked `UNGROUNDED` and listed first in the final report. With the default
> `orchestrator_escalate: none` those are real product decisions made on your behalf — read them
> before merging, or run with `--escalate=business` to be asked instead.

**Model.** The `orchestrate` skill pins `model: opus` + `effort: max` — the strongest tier alias
every Claude Code build resolves. If your account has the Mythos tier, change that one frontmatter
line in `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md` to `model: fable`. Stage-runners get each stage skill's own
declared model; the judgment agents still follow `judgment_model`.

## Interview depth (easy / medium / hard)

The Q&A skills open by setting a **depth dial** — one `AskUserQuestion` per run that tunes how much
the skill decides on its own vs. interrogates you. It changes *how many* questions you get, never
*what gets covered*:

- **easy** — the skill makes the reversible, low-stakes calls itself with sensible defaults, asks
  only the irreversible / high-blast-radius ones, and **lists every assumption it made** so you can
  veto. Minimal analyses; diagrams written + summarized (no per-item question).
- **medium** (default) — the balanced Socratic walk: one question per real decision.
- **hard** — walk every decision with the trade-off foregrounded, run the **full ideation analysis
  suite** (competitive research, three strategic approaches, multi-perspective review,
  devil's-advocate), and probe edge cases harder.

The default is `interview_depth` in `.claude/sdd.local.md` (else medium); override it per run, or
pass `--depth=easy|medium|hard`. Full semantics: [`skills/_shared/interview-depth.md`](./skills/_shared/interview-depth.md).

Two things the dial **never** weakens — they hold at every level:

- **Readable diagrams.** `design` and `sequences` confirm each diagram **in prose** (a plain-language
  walk of the flow + branches) and write the source to the file (where Obsidian renders it) — they
  **never dump raw Mermaid into the terminal** as the thing to approve. If `mmdc` is installed, an
  image is rendered too. ([`skills/_shared/diagram-presentation.md`](./skills/_shared/diagram-presentation.md))
- **Full use-case + acceptance-criteria coverage.** Every spec §4 user story and §5 AC is covered
  end-to-end: `specify` enforces a **use-case floor** (every user story carries ≥1 AC) and `clarify`
  re-catches a story that lost it; `sequences` maps each user story to a flow and each AC to a flow,
  a branch, or an explicit non-runtime N/A (no flow cap); and `review` traces the whole set through
  spec → sequences → data-model → api → tasks → implement, flagging anything that dropped out. Even
  `easy`/XS covers every use-case + AC — it just asks fewer questions about *how*.

## Target surfaces (what's being built)

`design` opens §4 by declaring the feature's **target surface(s)** — *what's being built* — grounded
in C4 container types: `backend-service`, `web-frontend` (SSR or SPA), `mobile-app`, `desktop-app`,
`cli`, `worker`, `library-sdk`. The choice is derived from the spec's "for whom" (the spec stays
product-level — it never names a surface), gated by the blast-radius gate (multi-surface usually
spawns an ADR), drawn as **one C4 container per surface** in SAD §5, and written to the SAD
frontmatter `target_surfaces: [...]`. Downstream stages **read** that declaration and gate their
output by it — they never re-derive it:

- **`api`** picks the contract form from the surface (HTTP/OpenAPI · gRPC · events · `cli.md` ·
  `public-api.md`); a UI surface *consumes* the backend contract rather than authoring one.
- **`sequences`** draws **UI-driven flows** (`<user>` → `<ui>` → `<service>`) for a UI surface.
- **`tasks`** adds a **`ui`** task layer for a UI surface (backend-only stays domain/infra/app/ports).
- **`plan-tests`** adds the **component / visual-regression / e2e-through-UI** tiers (the frontend
  "testing trophy") for a UI surface; `implement` detects the actual tools (Playwright / Storybook / …).
- **`review`** traces every acceptance criterion through *its* surface — a UI AC to a component /
  e2e-through-UI test, not only a backend one.
- **Reuse, don't reinvent.** `survey` inventories the existing **design system / components / tokens /
  styling** into `architecture-map.md` §Frontend; `design` / `tasks` / `implement` **compose and
  extend** it (modelled on the closest existing screen) instead of hand-rolling new UI — the frontend
  echo of the backend's match-the-repo + copy-the-closest-precedent.

It's **Option B** — frontend-awareness threaded through the existing stages (a `ui` layer,
UI-architecture ADRs, UI flows, frontend test tiers); there is deliberately **no** separate
component-tree / design-token / screen artifact. Full semantics:
[`skills/_shared/surfaces.md`](./skills/_shared/surfaces.md).

## Where the spec comes from

It's not an input you have to write — **`specify` produces it.** Its interview front asks 3–5
questions about the problem, the users, and what success looks like, then drafts the spec,
validates each acceptance criterion with you, and runs a clean-context critic before writing
`spec.md`. The idea is the input; the spec is the output.

## Where we study the codebase / hold the current architecture

The existing system is studied **once, in `survey`** (Step 0), which persists
`docs/architecture-map.md` — the current architecture: module layout, layering, datastores,
conventions, and a C4 of what exists. That map is the single source of "what's already here":

- **`specify`** reads it so the spec's constraints / non-goals reflect the real system (without
  leaking tech into the acceptance criteria).
- **`design`** reads it and **matches** the feature to that reality — the SAD describes *your*
  system extended, not a greenfield design in a vacuum. It re-scans (via `explorer`) only if
  the map is missing or stale.
- **`data-model`** and **`implement`** read it for the persistence + wiring conventions the new
  code must follow, instead of each re-discovering them.

So you don't re-open "what's the current architecture?" at every stage — `survey` answers it once
and the map carries it. Refresh the map (`survey` again) when the repo has drifted past the
`reflects_commit` it records. In `design`, decisions expensive to reverse cross a blast-radius
gate and become ADRs.

**On an empty project there's no current architecture to study — so `survey` establishes one.**
Its greenfield mode gauges how you want to engage, then picks the stack / structure / data approach
/ conventions with you (defaults-heavy), fixes them as the foundation (the same map, marked
`mode: greenfield-bootstrap`, + foundational ADRs for the irreversible choices), and emits a
scaffold `tasks.json`. `implement` then materializes the skeleton — anchored on a smoke test
(«builds + boots + the test and migration tooling run») rather than per-folder TDD. After that the
repo is real and the per-feature flow builds into it normally.

## The roadmap (the portfolio layer)

The backbone builds **one feature at a time**. `roadmap` is the layer **above** it — one living
`docs/roadmap.md` that shows the work *across* features, kept at **outcome altitude** (the "why",
not a feature-and-date list, which is the biggest source of planning waste):

- **Now** — committed, spec'd, in progress. Each item links to its `docs/features/<slug>/` (it
  doesn't restate the spec) + a status.
- **Next** — problems/opportunities, deliberately *not* yet spec'd, ordered by a light **RICE**
  score (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort). This is the candidate pool.
- **Later** — directional outcomes/themes, no detail.
- **Shipped** — what landed, with a link.

It stays current because the pipeline updates it: **`specify` promotes a feature to Now**, and
**`ship` moves it to Shipped** — delivery itself keeps the roadmap in sync, so it doesn't rot. It
carries a one-line "direction, not a promise" disclaimer and never carries dates.

## The implementation engine

`implement` reads `tasks.json`, builds a dependency DAG, and runs a **TDD cycle per task** —
`SELECT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → GATE → COMMIT`. It writes a failing test first, proves the
failure is for the right reason, writes the minimal code to pass, keeps refactors green, runs
the gate, and commits with `SDD-Task` / `SDD-AC` trailers.

Three execution modes, chosen automatically from settings + DAG shape (with graceful fallback):

- **Sequential single-agent TDD** — the default and the floor everything degrades to.
- **Agent team** (`team_mode: true`) — `test-author` → `implementer` → `reviewer`
  over the DAG, coordinated through a shared task list, one git worktree per agent.
- **Dynamic workflow** (`workflow_mode: auto`) — a generated `Workflow` pipeline that fans out
  independent tasks up to a parallelism cap.

## Models, effort & agents

Every skill and every agent declares an **execution profile** in its frontmatter — which model,
how much reasoning effort, and which agents it spawns:

```yaml
# a skill's frontmatter
model: opus        # haiku | sonnet | opus | fable | inherit (fable — reachable via judgment_model / env, agents keep tier-alias defaults)
effort: high       # low | medium | high | xhigh | max
agents: [critic]   # the agents this skill spawns
```

Model is chosen by the **kind of work**, not by taste:

| Kind of work | Model | Effort | Who |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestration (every decision in an autopilot run) | `opus` | `max` | `orchestrate` (the main session — not an agent) |
| Judgment (spec, design, review, critique, ambiguity, strategy) | `opus` | `high` | specify, clarify, design, review · `reviewer` / `critic` / `devils-advocate` / `strategist` / `analyst` |
| Execution (write tests, write code) | `sonnet` | `medium` → `high` on escalation | `test-author`, `implementer` |
| Research / gathering (+ web) | `sonnet` | `medium` | `researcher` (competitive / adjacent-solution research) |
| Search / scan / derivation | `haiku` / `inherit` | `low` / `medium` | `explorer`; data-model, api, sequences, tasks |
| Running one stage for the orchestrator | the stage skill's own `model` (passed per dispatch) | `high` | `stage-runner` |

The ten agents (`agents/`): **stage-runner** (runs one stage for the orchestrator), **explorer** (brownfield scan), **test-author** (failing tests),
**implementer** (makes them pass), **reviewer** (independent review), **critic**
(coherence critique), **devils-advocate** (ambiguity + failure-mode hunt), **researcher**
(competitive / web research), **strategist** (three strategic approaches), **analyst**
(multi-perspective review) — the read-only ones run in **clean isolated context** (fresh eyes) and
emit only cited findings. The last three are the **ideation analyses**, dispatched by `specify` and
gated by the depth dial (easy skips them; hard runs the full suite).

Two policy levers sit on top of the table. **`judgment_model`** (`.claude/sdd.local.md`;
`opus | fable`) raises **all** judgment agents (`reviewer` / `critic` / `devils-advocate` /
`strategist` / `analyst`) to the Mythos-tier model in one switch — `agents/*.md` keep their
tier-alias defaults; a per-role `model_<role>` key still wins. And on **L/XL** features the
critical verifications — the `reviewer` in `review` and the `critic` in `design`/`specify` — run
at **`effort: xhigh`** (via `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`); the rest of the judgment work stays `high`.

The full policy — override precedence (`env > invocation > model_<role> > judgment_model >
frontmatter > session`), the `.size` scaling, and the env-var fallback for the `effort:` no-op
some builds have — lives in one place: [`skills/_shared/agent-roster.md`](./skills/_shared/agent-roster.md).
Short version: if a run feels under-reasoned, set `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`.

### Configuration — `.claude/sdd.local.md`

The pipeline **auto-creates** this per-project settings file (YAML frontmatter) with **documented
defaults** the first time a skill needs it — normally `specify` at the start — and adds it to
`.gitignore` (it's per-developer). The file is **self-documenting**: every key carries its default,
its allowed values, and a one-line explanation inline. Edit it to change behaviour. Two keys are
**plugin-wide** — `interview_depth` is read by the Q&A skills (`specify` / `clarify` / `design`) to
pre-select the depth dial, and `artifact_language` is read by every artifact-writing skill: it sets
the language pipeline documents are written in — prose only, while section headings, frontmatter and
machine tokens stay English (full rule →
[`skills/_shared/artifact-language.md`](./skills/_shared/artifact-language.md)); the rest configure
the `implement` engine:

```yaml
interview_depth: medium    # easy | medium | hard — default depth for specify/clarify/design
artifact_language: en      # en | uk — the language pipeline documents are written in (headings + machine tokens stay English)
tdd: true                  # enforce red→green→refactor
team_mode: false           # true → agent team via TeamCreate
workflow_mode: auto        # auto → dynamic Workflow; off → never
max_parallel_agents: 3
isolation: worktree        # worktree | inplace (parallel>1 ⇒ forces worktree)
stop_on_red: true
max_red_retries: 3
gate_lint: true
gate_vet: true
require_integration: auto  # auto | always | never (Docker-probed)
auto_commit: per_task      # per_task | per_phase | off
branch_strategy: feature   # feature | current
cmd_test_unit: ""          # empty = autodetect (escape hatch)
cmd_test_integration: ""
cmd_lint: ""
cmd_vet: ""
model_test_author: sonnet  # per-role model + effort (see Models, effort & agents)
model_implementer: sonnet
model_reviewer: opus
judgment_model: opus       # opus | fable — one switch for all judgment agents (reviewer/critic/devils-advocate/strategist/analyst)
effort_test_author: medium # raised to high on escalation / for L-XL features
effort_implementer: medium
effort_reviewer: high
orchestrator_depth: medium # easy | medium | hard — the --depth /sdd:orchestrate passes to every Q&A stage
orchestrator_escalate: none # none | business | hard — which UNGROUNDED questions go back to you
orchestrator_max_review_loops: 2 # review → implement fix rounds before the orchestrator stops
orchestrator_open_pr: true # push + open the PR after ship (false = print the command)
```

Command detection is a stack-agnostic cascade: settings override → Makefile targets →
`package.json` scripts → language manifests (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, …) →
Docker probe for the integration tier.

## Quick start (idea → shipped)

**Autopilot:** `/sdd:orchestrate "<what you want>"` — one command, the sequence below is run for you
(see [The orchestrator](#the-orchestrator-autopilot)). **Hands-on:**

The argument every stage takes is the **feature slug** — a kebab-case name you make up once at
the start (here `checkout-discounts`). It becomes the folder every artifact lands in —
`docs/features/checkout-discounts/` — and is how each stage finds the previous stage's files,
so use the **same slug at every stage**.

```text
/sdd:survey                             # once per repo: map the current architecture
/sdd:specify       checkout-discounts   # interview → spec (reads the architecture map)
/sdd:clarify       checkout-discounts
/sdd:design        checkout-discounts
/sdd:sequences     checkout-discounts
/sdd:data-model    checkout-discounts
/sdd:api           checkout-discounts
/sdd:tasks         checkout-discounts
/sdd:plan-tests    checkout-discounts
/sdd:implement     checkout-discounts
/sdd:review        checkout-discounts   # independent review of the whole change
/sdd:ship          checkout-discounts   # verify it runs, changelog, PR
```

> **`/clear` between stages** — each stage is gated, re-reads its inputs from disk, and ends by
> printing the next `/sdd:…` command to copy (the handoff block). Loop-backs (`review` → `implement`)
> stay in context; utilities make `/clear` optional.

Three notes on the first run:

- **You don't need `classify-size` to start** — `specify` classifies the feature and writes
  `.size` itself when it's absent. Run `/sdd:classify-size <slug>` only to size it *before*
  specifying, or to re-classify when scope changes.
- **Skip the depth question** by passing the dial inline: `/sdd:specify checkout-discounts
  --depth=easy` (also on `clarify` / `design`; values `easy|medium|hard` — see
  [Interview depth](#interview-depth-easy--medium--hard)).
- Artifacts land in `docs/features/<slug>/`.

### Routes — quick / standard / full

A small feature doesn't need the full backbone — and it shouldn't need a confirmation at every
stage either. Alongside `.size`, classification writes a **route** to
`docs/features/<slug>/.route` (one word: `quick` / `standard` / `full`; defaults **XS/S → quick,
M → standard, L/XL → full**, confirmed together with the size in the **same single question** —
you can always pick a different route). The route decides how each handoff treats the optional
stages (`clarify`, `sequences`, `data-model`, `api`, `plan-tests`):

- **`quick`** — the stage checks the skip condition **itself**: if the stage's work doesn't exist,
  it's **auto-skipped with the reason stated** («auto-skipped clarify: zero open questions»), and
  the `↳ or …` line inverts to offer the full path instead. If the work *does* exist, the stage runs.
- **`standard`** — today's behaviour: the handoff **offers** the skip as `↳ or …` and you pick.
- **`full`** — every optional stage runs; no skip alternatives are printed.

Example — a config-toggle-sized feature (`quick` route) in one session:

```text
/sdd:specify  rate-limit-bump --depth=easy   # size XS + route quick confirmed in one question →
                                             #   zero open questions → auto-skips clarify (says why)
/sdd:design   rate-limit-bump                # one actor, no multi-step flow, no schema change →
                                             #   auto-skips sequences + data-model → next: api or tasks
/sdd:tasks    rate-limit-bump                # never skipped: implement consumes tasks.json
/sdd:implement rate-limit-bump               # test plan lives inline in spec.md on quick
/sdd:review   rate-limit-bump
/sdd:ship     rate-limit-bump
```

The skip conditions (`clarify` — zero open questions; `sequences` — no multi-step flow;
`data-model` — no schema change; `api` — no contract change; `plan-tests` — inline in the spec)
are canonical in [`skills/_shared/size-matrix.md`](./skills/_shared/size-matrix.md) — they're
**N/A conditions, not size defaults**: an XS feature *with* a migration still runs `data-model`,
on every route. The route steers handoffs only, it never locks a door: re-run
`/sdd:classify-size <slug>` to switch routes mid-flight, or just invoke a skipped stage directly —
it always runs.

### When a stage refuses

Stages are gated: each one **hard-refuses when the artifact it consumes is missing** and names the
stage to run first. A refusal is not an error — it's the pipeline telling you which step was
skipped. The ones you're most likely to meet:

| Refusal | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `design`: «run `specify` first» | there's no `spec.md` for this slug yet (or the slug is spelled differently) | run `/sdd:specify <slug>`; check the slug matches the folder under `docs/features/` |
| `api`: «run `data-model` first» | the feature **changes the schema** but has no `data-model.md` — the contract can't be invented field-by-field. (No schema change → `api` doesn't refuse: it derives from the existing schema — the legal fast-lane skip) | run `/sdd:data-model <slug>` |
| `tasks`: «no Accepted ADR» | `design` spawned no ADR (rare — usually a sign the SAD walk was cut short) | run `/sdd:decide-adr <slug>` for the key decision, or re-run `/sdd:design <slug>` |

## Roadmap

Directions under consideration — not promises, no dates:

- **`sync`** — spec↔code drift detection: re-derive what the code actually does and diff it
  against the spec/SAD, so long-lived features don't quietly outgrow their documents.
- **Traceability matrix + adherence score** — `review`/`ship` emit a single AC × (flow / contract
  / task / test / commit) matrix with a coverage score, instead of prose-only tracing.
- **Tracker integration** — `tasks.json` ⇄ Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues two-way sync (today the
  export is one-shot and copy-paste).
- **Constitution file** — a repo-level set of inviolable rules (security, compliance, style) every
  stage reads and the validator enforces, complementing the per-feature artifacts.

**Shipped:** ~~MCP exposure~~ → see **[The visual dashboard](#the-visual-dashboard-opt-in)** below.

## The visual dashboard (opt-in)

The roadmap's *"MCP exposure — pipeline state served over MCP so external tools and dashboards can read
where every feature stands"* has shipped — and gained a control surface. The plugin carries an
**`sdd-dashboard` MCP server** (`server/`, Bun + TypeScript) that auto-starts with every Claude Code
session (declared in `.mcp.json`) and, when enabled, serves a **local browser dashboard** (`dashboard/`)
on `127.0.0.1`. It reads every feature off disk (`docs/features/<slug>/`), shows its pipeline as a
per-step checklist — `done` / `skipped` / `pending` / `blocked` — and renders each artifact (markdown +
**mermaid** diagrams from vendored libs, fully offline; OpenAPI as plain YAML). Artifacts render in
whatever language they're written — the state derivation reads only the English structural tokens,
which never translate (see `artifact_language` above). Pure-markdown users who
never opt in are unaffected — nothing binds, nothing opens.

### Launch it — three steps

1. Install **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** (the server runtime — the same dependency the official Telegram
   plugin uses): `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash` or `brew install bun`.
2. Set `dashboard_enabled: true` in your project's `.claude/sdd.local.md`
   (see [Configuration](#configuration--claudesddlocalmd)).
3. Run **`/sdd:start`** in your Claude Code session. The server is already running — it auto-started
   with the session; this step just hands it your project directory, binds the port if needed, and
   prints the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?session=<id>&token=<capability-token>`. Open that exact
   URL in a browser — the token in it authorises the session.

A new session (or a server restart) mints a new token, so an old tab goes stale: re-run `/sdd:start`
and open the fresh URL.

### How the panel updates

Three mechanisms, layered:

1. **Live, from disk.** The server watches `docs/` (`fs.watch`) and pushes a refresh over the
   WebSocket whenever an artifact changes — no matter who changed it: a dashboard-driven run, a skill
   you ran in the terminal, or you editing `spec.md` in vim. Changes appear within ~1 second.
2. **Enriched, from Claude.** When Claude runs a stage it also calls `dashboard_update` /
   `dashboard_log` / `dashboard_done` — that is what feeds the live activity feed, stage transitions,
   review verdicts and the final handoff. A terminal-only run still refreshes the artifacts
   (mechanism 1); it just doesn't narrate.
3. **Self-healing connection.** The server pings the WebSocket to keep it alive; if it drops anyway,
   the browser reconnects with backoff and re-syncs everything from disk — nothing stays stale.

### How you control it

The **▶ Run next stage** / per-stage **run** / **⚒ Fix** (appears on a CHANGES REQUESTED review) /
**+ new** buttons drive your live session — with honest **asynchronous** semantics:

- A click sends the request to the server, which builds a validated `/sdd:<skill> <slug>` command from
  a strict server-side allowlist and **queues** it into your Claude session — over the same channel
  mechanism the official Telegram plugin uses (`notifications/claude/channel`).
- The session consumes a queued command **only while idle at the prompt**. If Claude is mid-task, the
  command waits; every queued command gets its own `queued → running → done` status line and the UI
  never fakes synchronous execution.
- The **depth selector** (topbar) sets `--depth` for dashboard-driven runs: `easy` (default — skills
  self-decide reversible calls and rarely block on questions), `medium`, or `hard`.
- If a dashboard-driven run genuinely needs a human decision, Claude posts the question **into the
  panel** (`dashboard_ask`): a card with 2–4 option buttons appears in the activity pane and the run
  pauses; your click sends the answer back through the same queue and the run resumes. The browser
  only ever sends an option *index* — the option text was authored by Claude itself. You can always
  answer in the terminal instead.
- Free browser text can never become a command — only the validated skill name + slug + depth pass
  the allowlist.

### What the panel does NOT do

- It never writes to disk — artifacts are edited only by the pipeline in your terminal.
- It has no chat input, and a blocking `AskUserQuestion` in the **terminal** stays terminal-only —
  the panel's option cards exist precisely so dashboard-driven runs don't block there, but free text
  never travels from the browser into the session.
- It doesn't survive a server restart — re-run `/sdd:start` for a fresh URL/token.

**Setup, config & troubleshooting:** [`server/README.md`](./server/README.md).

**Security:** binds loopback only; the API is read-only and every read is realpath-contained to `docs/`
with an extension allowlist; all routes require a per-session capability token; inbound commands are built
**only** from a server-side skill + slug allowlist (browser text never becomes an arbitrary `/sdd:` command).
